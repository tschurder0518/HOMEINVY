Project: HOMEINVY
Assignment #1 - ReadMe

Requirements: Assignment #1
-Incorporate abstract class
-Incorporate polymorphism
-Incorporate inheritance
-Incorporate downcasting/upcasting

HOMEINVY Requirements implemented as well:
-Create the program hierarchy (10 classes total)
-Display all items in the inventory and their properties (hard-coded at this time)

Design:
-See class and sequence diagrams in assignment 1 document for more details

 Run:
 -Run the program from the items_test/ItemDisplayExample.java. Currently all
 testing is by hard coded creation of objects and then displaying the associated
 information. Current hard coding creates 6 different objects, one of each concrete
 type. Each of these objects and their properties will be the resulting output
 after execution.
